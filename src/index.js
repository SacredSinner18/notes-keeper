import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// part 1
//1. Create a new React app.
//2. Create a App.jsx component.
//3. Create a Header.jsx component that renders a <header> element
//to show the Keeper App name in an <h1>.
//4. Create a Footer.jsx component that renders a <footer> element
//to show a copyright message in a <p> with a dynamically updated year.
//5. Create a Note.jsx component to show a <div> element with a
//<h1> for a title and a <p> for the content.

// part 2
//Challenge. Render all the notes inside notes.js as a seperate Note
//component.

// part 3

//CHALLENGE:
//1. Implement the add note functionality.
//- Create a constant that keeps track of the title and content.
//- Pass the new note back to the App.
//- Add new note to an array.
//- Take array and render seperate Note components for each item.

//2. Implement the delete note functionality.
//- Callback from the Note component to trigger a delete function.
//- Use the filter function to filter out the item that needs deletion.
//- Pass a id over to the Note component, pass it back to the App when deleting.

//This is the end result you're aiming for:
